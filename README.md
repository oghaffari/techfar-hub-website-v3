## Background

This is the third generation of the TechFAR Hub, with the work beginning September 2022 and wrappinng up January 2023. The current TechFar Hub site was a valuable resource for digital IT acquisition when it was first launched many years ago, but since then it has gone stale. Several attempts have been made to revive it, none led to a successful, living site. If we are able to revamp content and navigation based on research and understanding of the digital IT acquisition professional community, then the TechFar Hub can become relevant again as the leading source of critical thinking and community.

For government acquisition professionals, TechFar Hub is the leading voice in digital services procurement best practices. 
Unlike other sites, TechFar Hub is completely focused on digital services acquisition, offering critical thinking, promoting resources and connecting the community.

## Objective: Update site content to be fresh, relevant and easy to navigate.

Key result 1: Devise a research-backed information architecture which makes it easy to find things

Key result 2: Audit current content and create new content that reflects current thought leadership

Key result 3: Create a strategy for gathering & promoting resources from the wider community
