# Github for content editors

While github isn't exactly meant for content entry, by adding an interface to [git](https://git-scm.com/) and a text editor, it does a serviceable job as our CMS. Below, we'll cover a couple core git concepts that you'll need for updating TechFAR Hub (and most any other static site that uses github pages). Specifically, we'll cover:

-  Branches: A way of keeping all of your edits together and previewing them before they go live
-  Commits: The basic unit 
-  Pull requests
-  Actions
-  The editor
