## The idea of testing as you go for Agile software development seems like it would slow the project down or create bottlenecks. How do you avoid this?

Agile testing adds Quality Assurance (QA) and is implemented in the first sprint. Breaking the project into sprints allows the team to focus on the development process and give rapid, continuous feedback. Testing needs to happen early and often, instead of waiting for development to be finished. As working software is available, the testing should continue to proactively address issues and potential bugs within an application during the development cycles.

**Stages of QA Process**

- Analyze Requirements
- Plan the tests
- Design the tests
- Execute Tests and Report Defects
- Run Re-Tests and Regression Tests
- Run Release Tests

**QA Values**

- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
