## Without having detailed system requirements documented up front, how will the Government ensure it has appropriate documentation and know whether a contractor is performing?

Agile software development requires documentation for user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks to be completed to fulfill the “definition of done,” code quality, and standards compliance. Because the Government is able to monitor progress, it will know whether a contractor is off track. The Agile software development approach involves a highly disciplined process with Government representation on the team to set priorities and ensure whether working software is compliant with contract or system requirements. Progress will be monitored by the delivery of deployable code on time.

Under the Agile methodology, documentation is produced through interactions between the product owner, other stakeholders and the contractor throughout the development process involving sprint cycles and releases, which supplement the high-level Product Vision and refine the requirements to reflect experience from completed iterations.


- Working software is produced in short iterations (which can be as frequently as every 1-4 weeks[17]), which produces a segment of functionality (e.g., end user being able to schedule an appointment online).
- Each iteration is small in scale (i.e., encompass a single or a few function(s) within a multistep process). Multiple iterations form releases.
- For each iteration, requirements, design, and development of software are identified through “user stories” produced by the product owner to identify and prioritize core requirements that are needed to produce a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP contains the just enough core functions of the system to be able to get validated learning from users about the system. Features that may be useful, but not essential, are not considered until the MVP is delivered.
- Testing of the software determines whether it meets the stated requirements.Product backlogs are maintained to ensure that functionalities not included in early iterations that remain desirable are incorporated into future iterations.

In each iteration, the Product Owner may evaluate whether working software is responsive by looking at documentation from user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks to be completed to fulfill the “definition of done,” code quality, and standards compliance. The agency must generate all documentation required by law, regulation, and policy.
