## Given Agile software development contracts are broken into sprints, can they be terminated before the contract end date?

Agile software development contracts are designed to allow regular points of inspection throughout the project lifecycle. At each of these points, agencies may choose to continue with the project or take what has been produced thus far and terminate. The frequency of these inspection points and the conditions for termination is negotiated into the contract.
