<Summary>
- Agile software development is new to the Goovernment, but has been successfully practiced in private industry for many years.
- Agile software development methods promote effective risk management through continuous testing and short feedback loops to improve outcomes on a recurring basis.
</Summary>
## Because Agile software development is a new process, doesn’t it entail more risk?

Even though Agile software development is a new practice to the Government, it dates back to the 1970s and has been used in private industry for many years (as well as some Government agencies) where it repeatedly demonstrated a shortened time to value, enabled better adaption to changing need, and lowered the risk of project failure. These results make a compelling case to adopt Agile in federal IT projects and ensure acquisitions support these efforts. Moreover, careful selection of contract type will mitigate risk as discussed in Section E.

For many years, private industry has realized benefits from Agile software development[*10*], and some Government agencies have begun to benefit from Agile for their software development contracts. Agile software development methods promote effective risk management through continuous testing and short feedback loops to improve outcomes on a recurring basis. Because the Agile process forces problems to be identified early, failure occurs on a small scale with time for corrective action. This reduces the risk of the Government ending up with a product after a long design period that may not meet its needs or that contains unused features, or of an outright failure. In addition, use of Agile software development methods will increase focus on the development of mobile solutions, which are advantageous to today’s workforce.

### Use of Agile Processes by DOD’s Defense Health Service Systems to Improve Medical Readiness

Starting in 2012, DOD used Agile (Scrum) processes to enhance the Defense Medical Human Resources System-internet (DMHRSi). This system helps to manage current and future medical human resources needs. DOD’s use of Agile processes resulted in:

- A reduction in the average number of days required to deliver a new software release from 419 days to 58 days (representing ~87% improvement in time to market)
- A massive reduction in Help Desk tickets by 87%
- Increased customer satisfaction
- Production of a better product

Multiple studies of the traditional “waterfall” process, where requirements are defined and documented in full detail before any testing or customer input is received, indicate a low rate of success and a high incidence of paying for features that are never used.[*11*] There is also a statutory mandate to use modular contracting to the maximum extent practicable for software development that is a major system.[*12*] Successful application of Agile software development, like all strategies that are newly adopted in the Government, will require training and a support structure to share best practices and lessons learned. The TechFAR Handbook and Smarter Digital Services Playbook are just one step. OMB, in close collaboration with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, and the Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE), will work with agencies to support these efforts.

Acquisition personnel – and other stakeholders – should expect that Agile is a cross-functional and highly interactive process – both between agency team members and with the contractor. Therefore, IPT members – the Program/Project Managers (P/PM), IT Specialists, the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist, and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) – should be co-located, either virtually or in person.[*13*]

Agile requires that the IPT learns better what the end user needs through testing[*14*] and a culture that supports this approach. Therefore, P/PMs, COs, CORs, and other stakeholders need to be aware that Agile software development will not produce the final expected result with the first iteration, but instead will provide usable, working software that can be iteratively improved[*15*]; it requires “touch and feel” and user feedback to get the technical features right and arrive at the final product.
