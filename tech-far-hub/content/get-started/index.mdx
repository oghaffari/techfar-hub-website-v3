Welcome to the TechFAR Hub, a resource to help government acquisition and program professionals buy, build, and deliver modern digital services while staying on the correct side of compliance! We have reorganized TechFAR Hub since its original release. Now you will find content arranged by phases of the acquisition lifecycle. Here are some recommendations on how to use the TechFAR Hub, and how you can help us make it better.

1. First Step

    I'm the content for the first step. Look how cool I am.
    - There's a sub list in Here
    - Man it's also cool!

2. Second Step

    I'm the content for the second step, I'm also cool.

3. Third Step

    I'm the content for the third step. Less cool I guess.

4. Last step

    Looks like Matt got tired of typing steps

## How to use TechFAR Hub

<ProcessList>
1. Determine Where You Are in the Acquisition Lifecycle

    Whether you’re working a brand new procurement or need some help with evaluation criteria, we make it easy to find the help you need. Content is organized into four acquisition lifecycle stages: 

    1. [Pre-Solicitation](../pre-solicitation/),
    2. [Solicitation](../solicitation/), 
    3. [Evaluation](../evaluation/), 
    4. [Contract Administration](../contract-administration/). 
    
    Within each stage, you’ll find relevant guidance, tools, and templates to help you succeed. [Link to Acq Lifecycle Landing Page]

2. Browse Tools, Templates, and Samples

    Looking for inspiration? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, which is why we’re collecting a repository of useful tools, templates and samples proven to be successful in the public sector. Jump directly to this page and see what’s in our library, and find out how you can contribute your own. [Link to this Resources subpage]

3. Review Our Case Studies

    Case studies are a great way to learn from the success of others. We’re adding new case studies often, in collaboration with smart professionals all over the government. Do you have a case study or situation you think would make a great case study? We’d love to consider it for inclusion in the TFH! You may even get some swag out of it.
