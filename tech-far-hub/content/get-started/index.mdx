Welcome to the TechFAR Hub, a resource to help government acquisition and program professionals buy, build, and deliver modern digital services while staying on the correct side of compliance! We have reorganized TechFAR Hub since its original release. Now you will find content arranged by phases of the acquisition lifecycle. Here are some recommendations on how to use the TechFAR Hub, and how you can help us make it better.

<MultiStep>

1. Pre-Solicitation

    The pre-solicitation phase of the acquisition lifecycle is where planning, market research, and requirements development occur.

2. Solicitation

    After you’ve completed pre-solicitation activities, it’s time to solicit offers from industry during the solicitation phase.

3. Evaluation

   Offers are in and it’s time to select the contractor who is best suited for the job, based on the criteria you develop in the Evaluation phase of the acquisition lifecycle.

4. Contract Administration

    When you’ve completed all the pre-award activities, from acquisition planning through evaluation and award, it’s time to focus on delivery.
