Traditional federal government training and procurement practices often inhibit agencies' ability to effectively acquire and implement modern IT/Digital Services, because they lag behind the rapidly changing technology and markets. Timely, relevant, and continuous training for acquisition professionals is the key to keeping pace.

Accordingly, the United States Digital Service (USDS) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) collaborated to develop a specialized and immersive training and development program called the Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP).

## What is DITAP?

This training and development program teaches federal government acquisition professionals to design innovative and flexible procurements for IT/Digital Services, and how to become change ambassadors. Once completed all students earn 60 to 80 Continuous Learning Requirements (CLs), and a Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) FAC-C Credential in Digital Services (FAC-C-DS) credential.

- Each DITAP class is called a cohort
- Each cohort has a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 30 students
- Each cohort runs for approximately 6-months
- Agency-only cohorts consist of students from one agency
- Open-agency cohorts consist of students from various agencies
- All cohorts are being held remotely, and there are no travel requirements
- Agencies are required to cover all travel costs for in-person cohorts

## DITAP Learning Objectives, Competencies, and Performance Outcomes

After completing the program, acquisition professionals will be able to:

- Execute digital service procurements and act as qualified business advisors on digital services over FAR 13.500(c) thresholds.
- Work directly within an agency digital services team or acquisition innovation lab to serve as a business advisor to the team, its customers, and stakeholders.
- Lead agency training workshops and consult on ways to expand digital service procurement expertise throughout the federal government.

## How to enroll

There are many ways students and agencies can enroll:

1. For large acquisition shops with the need to train at least 25 students at the same time

   - Agencies should contact the DITAP provider directly and negotiate a contract for an agency-only cohort

2. For smaller acquisition shops with the need to send one or a few students

   - Agencies should have their student visit the DITAP provider’s website and apply to attend a scheduled open-agency cohort
   - If there are no open-agency cohort dates advertised, agencies should complete the ‘Contact Us’ form on the DITAP provider's website
   - If enough interest is shown they may open an open-agency cohort

3. Periodically, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) sponsors a no-cost open-agency cohort
   - This option is best for agencies with limited training budgets
   - FAI posts this information on [FAI.gov](https://www.fai.gov/), and in the FAI newsletter Acquisition Today
   - These cohorts typically fill up within 30-minutes of the posting, so interested students should sign up to receive the newsletter via email by visiting the FAI site
   - FAI does not cover any travel costs

## DITAP Providers

There are two types of DITAP providers--Authorized and Contingent.

- Authorized. Have met all the required criteria, demonstrated the ability to build and run their DITAP program, and have successfully run multiple cohorts.
- Contingent. Has shown interest in becoming an Authorized provider, and built its DITAP program, but has not run a cohort. USDS works closely with these providers to ensure they meet specific criteria and demonstrate they have a full understanding of what is required to run the DITAP program before being placed in contingent status. USDS attends and closely monitors the first cohort and provides feedback. Once they complete their first cohort, they are moved to authorized or given feedback about any necessary changes before they can be moved to authorized.

DITAP providers create and schedule cohorts based on the interest they receive. If more interest is received, they can open more cohorts to meet agencies' training needs. There is no financial assistance for this training, and it is up to each agency to negotiate with the DITAP providers.

Agencies can negotiate with Authorized and Contingent providers, and can send students to open-enrollment cohorts offered by the providers. Level II/III FAC-C students who graduate from either type of provider receive a FAC-C-DS certification.

To find more detailed information about cost, schedule, or basic details visit the provider's website using the links below and fill out their 'Contact Us' form. The links may not work on all federal government computers, so you may have to copy and paste them into your browser.

## FAQs for Graduates of DITAP

**CL's**

- After you graduate you will receive a certificate from the DITAP provider.
- It is the graduate's responsibility to upload the certificate to FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). Students should follow guidance on the FAI website.
- Once the certificate is uploaded, graduates need to work with their supervisor/acquisition career manager to get everything approved.

**Graduates Information**

- DITAP providers send USDS a list with all graduates' names.
- This information is used to track the number of graduates and to add your name to LISTSERV.

**LISTSERV**

- Your email will be added to the DITAP Alumni LISTSERV which is used to communicate with all alumni.
- You will receive an email once your name has been added.
- If you do not want to be part of the LISTSERV, you can unsubscribe yourself
  - To unsubscribe from the DITAP list, create a new email message, addressed to DITAP-unsubscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov.
  - The message content does not matter and the sender's email address will be removed from the list.
  - To join again, any current or former DITAP student with a .gov or .mil email address can join the list by creating a new email message addressed to DITAP-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov (Subject and Message Body are ignored and the sender's email address will be added to the list.)

**Maintaining a FAC-C-DS**

Graduates need to keep their skills fresh and keep up with new technologies, methods, and companies that are introduced to the ecosystem. 

To maintain certification, 20 of the required **80** FAC-C CLs should be earned by participating in additional IT/Digital Service training/activities. 

After **May 1, 2024**, the total number of CLs required for a FAC-C (Professional) will change to 100 every two years. To maintain a FAC-C-DS certificate, 20 of the **100** required FAC-C (Professional) CLs should be earned by participating in additional IT/Digital Service training/activities.

Acquisition professionals should coordinate with their acquisition career manager and/or supervisor to confirm the CLs are approved for each activity. Once the CLs are achieved, a document listing all the activities should be uploaded into CSOD. Do not forget to include any preparation work in the CLP count, as shown in the example below.

Activity | Time Spent Developing Content for Presentation | Total Earned CLs
---------------------- | :-: |----------------------
1-Hour Conference Presenter | 4 hours | 5 hours
