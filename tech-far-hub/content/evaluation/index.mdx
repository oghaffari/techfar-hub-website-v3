Offers are in and itâ€™s time to select the contractor who is best suited for the job, based on the criteria you develop in the Evaluation phase of the acquisition lifecycle. Evaluating agile contracts is a bit different than what you may have done in the past for traditional service, product, or construction type contracts. Here we provide resources for composing technical and price evaluation criteria, using innovative methods to identify the vendors who are best suited for delivering results under an agile methodology, and templates and case studies to support your evaluation teams.
