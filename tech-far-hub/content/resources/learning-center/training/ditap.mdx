Traditional federal government training and procurement practices often inhibit agencies ability to effectively acquire and implement modern IT/Digital Services, because they lag behind the rapidly changing technology and markets. Timely, relevant, and continuous training for acquisition professionals is the key to keeping pace.

Accordingly, the United States Digital Service (USDS) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) collaborated to develop a specialized and immersive training and development program called the Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP).

## What is DITAP?

This training and development program teaches federal government acquisition professionals to design innovative and flexible procurements for IT/Digital Services, and how to become change ambassadors. Once completed all students earn 60 to 80 Continuous Learning Points (CLP’s), and Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) holders earn a Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) FAC-C Core Plus Specialization in Digital Services (FAC-C-DS) certificate.

- Each DITAP class is called a cohort
- Each cohort has a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 30 students
- Each cohort runs for approximately 6-months
- Agency-only cohorts consist of students from one agency
- Open-agency cohorts consist of students from various agencies
- Due to COVID-19 all cohorts are being held remotely, and there are no travel requirements
- Agencies are required to cover all travel costs for in-person cohorts

## DITAP Learning Objectives, Competencies and Performance Outcomes

After completing the program, acquisition professionals will be able to:

- Execute digital service procurements and act as qualified business advisors
- Work directly within an agency digital services team or acquisition innovation lab to serve as a business advisor to the team, its customers, and stakeholders
- Lead agency training workshops and consult on ways to expand digital service procurement expertise throughout the federal government

## Who can enroll in the DITAP program?

Per the 2018 “Establishment of Federal Acquisition Certification in Core-Plus Specialization in Digital Services” memo, **Level II/III FAC-C** acquisition professionals assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services over FAR 13.500(c) thresholds are **required** to enroll in DITAP.

Per the 2022 memo, **Level II/III Federal Acquisition Certification for Contracting Officer’s Representatives (FAC-COR) and Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers (FAC-P/PM)** acquisition professionals assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services over FAR 13.500(c) thresholds should be **encouraged** to attend DITAP training to create a cohesive team that fully understands how to buy digital services:

- Level II/III FAC-COR and Level II/III FAC-P/PM holders should be encouraged to register for DITAP starting October 2022
- FAC-C holders who are required to take DITAP are given first priority during registration
- FAC-COR/PM holders are placed on a waitlist and allowed to complete registration if all the seats aren’t filled
- Currently, FAC-COR/PM holders earn the CLP's and receive a “certificate of completion” but not a FAC-C-DS certificate. We are currently considering options regarding earning a FAC-C-DS certificate for non FAC-C holders.

## How to enroll

There are a number of ways students and agencies can enroll:

1. For large acquisition shops with the need to train at least 25 students at the same time

   - Agencies should contact the DITAP provider directly and negotiate a contract for an agency-only cohort

2. For smaller acquisition shops with the need to send one or a few students

   - Agencies should have their student visit the DITAP provider’s website and apply to attend a scheduled open-agency cohort
   - In the event that there are no open-agency cohort dates advertised, agencies should complete the ‘Contact Us’ form on the DITAP providers website
   - If enough interest is shown they may open an open-agency cohort

3. Periodically, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) sponsors a no-cost open-agency cohort
   - This option is best for agencies with limited training budgets
   - FAI posts this information on [FAI.gov](https://www.fai.gov/), and in the FAI newsletter Acquisition Today
   - These cohorts typically fill up within 30-minutes of the posting, so interested students should sign up to receive the newsletter via email by visiting the FAI site
   - FAI does not cover any travel costs

## DITAP Providers

There are two types of DITAP providers--Authorized and Contingent.

- Authorized have met all the required criteria, demonstrated the ability to build and run their own DITAP program, and have successfully run multiple cohorts.
- Contingent have shown interest in becoming an Authorized provider, and have built their own DITAP program, but have not actually run a cohort. USDS works closely with these providers to ensure they meet specific criteria and demonstrate they have a full understanding of what is required to run the DITAP program before being placed in contingent status. USDS attends and closely monitors the first cohort and provides feedback. Once they complete their first cohort, they are moved to authorized or given feedback about any necessary changes before they can be moved to authorized.

DITAP providers create and schedule cohorts based on the interest they receive. If more interest is received, they can open more cohorts to meet agencies' training needs. There is no financial assistance for this training, and it is up to each agency to negotiate with the DITAP providers.

Agencies can negotiate with Authorized and Contingent providers, and can send students to open enrollment cohorts offered by the providers. Level II/III FAC-C students who graduate from either type of provider receive a FAC-C-DS certification.

## FAQ's for Graduates of DITAP

**CLP's**

- Once you have successfully completed the course, you will receive a certificate from the DITAP provider.
- It is the graduates responsibility to upload the certificate to FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD). Students should follow guidance on the FAI website.
- Once the certificate is uploaded, graduates need to work with their supervisor/acquisition career manager to get everything approved.

**Graduates Information**

- DITAP providers send USDS a list with all graduates' names.
- This information is used to track the number of graduates and to add your name to LISTSERV (see below).

**LISTSERV**

- Your email will be added to the DITAP Alumni LISTSERV which is used to communicate with all alumni.
- You will receive an email once your name has been added.
- If you do not want to be part of the LISTSERV, you can unsubscribe yourself
  - To unsubscribe from the DITAP list, create a new email message, addressed to DITAP-unsubscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov.
  - The message content does not matter and the sender's email address will be removed from the list.
  - To join again, any current or former DITAP student with a .gov or .mil email address can join the list by creating a new email message addressed to DITAP-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov (Subject and Message Body are ignored and the sender's email address will be added to the list.)

**Maintaining a FAC-C-DS**

After completing DITAP it is important for graduates to keep their skills fresh, keep up with new technologies, methods, and companies that are introduced to the ecosystem.

To maintain certification, 20 of the required 80 FAC-C CLP’s should be earned by participating in additional IT/Digital Service training/activities. Acquisition professionals should coordinate with their acquisition career manager and/or supervisor to confirm the CLP’s are approved for each activity. Once the CLP’s are achieved, a document listing all the activities should be uploaded into CSOD. Do not forget to include any preparation work in the CLP count, as shown in the example below.

Activity | Time Spent Developing Content for Presentation | Total Earned CLP's
---------------------- | :-: |----------------------
1-Hour Conference Presenter | 4 hours | 5 hours

Per the [FAI Guidance on Meeting the Requirement for Continuous Learning Points](https://www.fai.gov/training/continuous-learning-opportunities), there are many activities available to earn CLP’s.
