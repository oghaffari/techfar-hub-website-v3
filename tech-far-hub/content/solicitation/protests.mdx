## Doesn’t the fact that technical requirements for Agile software development are not defined substantially increase the risk of a protest?

No. The fact that technical requirements are developed through an Agile process should not increase the risk of a protest.

### Tips for Successful Solicitation and Evaluation

**Use presentations as part of the technical evaluation**

- Consider including language in the solicitation that the Government intends to require oral presentations as part of the offeror’s technical portion of its quote or proposal. This will enable the Government to determine whether an offeror truly knows Agile software development. This is not mandatory, but has proven to be effective for some agencies.  
- Oral presentations need to be tightly controlled and recorded to ensure that all offerors are treated equally, that the Government does not inadvertently open discussions, and to create a defendable record of the agency’s actions. 
- If using oral presentations, consider using them after the competitive range is established. 
- The Government should clearly spell out the intended use of oral presentations in the Evaluation Criteria if it chooses to use them.

**Integrate agile into the technical factors in the Request for Quote (RFQ)** 

Example:
   
- Factor 1 – Performance Work Statement: Offerors shall provide a Performance Work Statement in response to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and this RFQ. The proposed solution shall include an explanation of how project and contract management, communication/collaboration with the Government, security and privacy requirements, documentation, and reporting will function in conjunction with the proposed Agile methodology.
   
- Factor 2 – Product Development Roadmap: Offerors shall propose an Agile product development roadmap which correlates how the stated objective aligns with the timeframe for implementation and the offeror’s proposed Agile methodology. The product development roadmap shall demonstrate where testing, training, security, privacy, and cut over planning, will be included. 
   
- Factor 3 – Notional Quality Control Plan (QCP): Offerors shall describe the QCP and Performance Measurement approach, including how proposed performance standards will be monitored, evaluated, and reported. The purpose of the notional QCP is to provide evaluators with an understanding of how measures and metrics will be applied based on the proposed technical solution.

**Request agile software development-specific information from offerors** 

- As part of the technical evaluation, request information from the offerors addressing how they manage Agile implementation, techniques for release planning, plans for engaging end users, methods for capturing and applying lessons learned, testing processes, reasons behind the composition of their Agile teams and the rationale behind the proposed development talent and project oversight (tied to Product Vision), how they will make resources available within schedule and budget constraints, and their approach to configuration management.

**Evaluate demonstrated experience with agile** 

- As part of the past experience evaluation criterion, include demonstrated experience with successfully developing software using an Agile approach. This could include a sample of code written and the results of that code.

The contract requirements description for Agile software development contracts and the fact that technical requirements are developed through the Agile process should not increases the risk of protest.  Requirements must be defined to the SOO level to allow for vendors to know if they want to compete, and the Government must evaluate based on stated evaluation factors and apply the evaluation criteria consistently among offerors. This is really no different than long-standing requirements applicable to all competitively awarded contracts.  Of course, a good debriefing may also help to ward off protests by helping an unsuccessful offeror to understand its weaknesses and how it can be more competitive in future competitions.
